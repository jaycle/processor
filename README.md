# README should be updated with questions, ideas, problems and solutions.

## Todo:

* Rework IMEM for hardocded values
* Get working test bench for non pipelined
* Case statements for Decoder

Should we do a case statement for the decoder?  It would work no doubt, but right now there is an FSM and it appears to be set up well.  What are your thoughts?

Whatever you think. If something works lets not reinvent it unless we don't understand it. Sorry I didn't see this before.
